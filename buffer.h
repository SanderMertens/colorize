/* A buffer builds up a list of elements which individually can be up to N bytes
 * large. While appending, data is added to these elements. More elements are
 * added on the fly when needed. When an application calls corto_buffer_str, all
 * elements are combined in one string and the element administration is freed.
 *
 * This approach prevents reallocs of large blocks of memory, and therefore
 * copying large blocks of memory when appending to a large buffer. A buffer
 * preallocates some memory for the element overhead so that for small strings
 * there is hardly any overhead, while for large strings the overhead is offset
 * by the reduced time spent on copying memory.
